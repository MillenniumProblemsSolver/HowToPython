# HowToPython

this is a collection of Python3 example scripts, which should serve as a basis to develop further applications. You can find easy but also hard examples in this repository. 

The repository is currently in the development phase and should make it easier for newcomers to get started with the language. You are welcome to add examples to provide even better support. I will regularly fill the repository with new examples. You can also draw attention to examples, that are not yet available, in the issues.
